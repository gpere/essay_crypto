  <h1>Bitcoin Could be a Soon-To-Be Regulated Currency, But People don't want it to be.</h1>
  <p>Bitcoin is a new, up and coming currency. It is unregulated, and can be 'mined' using complex computer algorythms. It is based around the technology of a 'blockchain',<br>
  a decentralized public ledger of all transactions in a cryptocurrency. The US goverment sees this as the equivilant of the synonomous 'Swiss bank account',<br>
  basically, something that they cannot control or tax. And, as we all know, the government loves taxes. As a hearing going in favor of Bitcoin wore on, the price went up to 7,300USD<br>
  as you can see from the graph below, if you go all the way to the right, it started to climb after the hearing. this also coincides with a resurgance in google searches for bit coin, as you can see form the other graph.
