  <h1>Bitcoin Could be a Soon-To-Be Regulated Currency, But People don't want it to be.</h1>
  <p>Bitcoin is a new, up and coming currency. It is unregulated, and can be 'mined' using complex computer algorythms. It is based around the technology of a 'blockchain',<br>
  a decentralized public ledger of all transactions in a cryptocurrency. The US goverment sees this as the equivilant of the synonomous 'Swiss bank account',<br>
  basically, something that they cannot control or tax. And, as we all know, the government loves taxes. As a hearing going in favor of Bitcoin wore on, the price went up to 7,300USD<br>
  as you can see from the graph below, if you go all the way to Febuary 6, 2018, it started to climb after the hearing. This also coincides with a resurgance in google searches for Bitcoin, as you can see from the other graph.</p>

<p>I believe Bitcoin is a bubble, and it will soon pop. There is no telling when, but it will. Cryptocurrency in general is a pretty new market, and probably should be regulated.<br>
  It is simply overpriced right now. It is also unfair to PC gamers for the reason that it drives up the price of graphics cards, the component that renders all of the graphics in a game.<br>
  Cards that used to retail at 700USD are now at prices almost double that.</p>
